# Optimizing-Online-Sports-Retail-Revenue-SQL
In the project "Optimizing Revenue from Online Sports Retailing," we have product data for an online sportswear company. We are dealing with a variety of information stored in several tables. The information includes prices, discounts, revenue, ratings, reviews, product descriptions, and website traffic.

We need to determine what can increase the company's revenue and therefore we are looking for answers to the following questions:
1. Is there a difference in the amount of discount offered between the brands?
2. How do the price points of Nike and Adidas products differ?
3. Is there any correlation between revenue and reviews? And if so, how strong is it?
4. Does the length of a product's description influence a product's rating and reviews?
5. Are there any trends or gaps in the volume of reviews by month?
6. How much of the company's stock consists of footwear items? What is the median revenue generated by these products?
7. How does footwear's median revenue differ from clothing products?
